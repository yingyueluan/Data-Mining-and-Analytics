    "The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between useful votes and number of times of positive words (\"awesome\", \"great\" and \"best\") used in reviews. Specifically, by conducting the reseach, we can answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. Were there clusters that represented very useful reviews but not mentioning any positive words?\n",
    "2. Does the cluster with the highest percetage of useful votes has the most number of occurrences of \"awesome\" (i.e. \"great\", \"best\")?\n",
    "3. Using the the sum of within cluster variance metric with the elbow method, what was the best k?"

The new dataset therefore has each row representing one reviewer. Features kept in the new dataset are average reviews per reviewers and sum of number of cool/funny/useful votes. We then added the natural log and the percentage of cool/funny/useful votes. We further processed text, date, and stars features from the original dataset. For example, we calculated the number of year the reviewer has been active and the number of times the word service appears in review. In the end, we transformed the initial dataset into a 171639 $\\times$ 43 dataframe.\t\t"

In cluster 3, only 4.86% of the reviews are useful and accordingly, positive words have the lowest usage among three cluster. We can further interpret the results to say that people tend not to consider reviews with all praises to be useful since in cluster 1, reviewers have 96.04% of useful votes do not write a lot of good words about the businesses.
